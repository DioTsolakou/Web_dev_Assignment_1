                <h2>What is raytracing?</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>According to Wikipedia<a href="sources.html"><sup>(1)</sup></a> , raytracing is a rendering technique in 3D graphics. A method of generating
                        an image by tracing the path of light and simulating the effects it has on the objects in the surrounding area.
                        <br>The reason for its use is due to the highly realistic results that it produces, often blurring the line
                        between reality and virtual images if given the time and done correctly.
                        <br>For these results, however, raytracing requires a considerable amount of resources and time.
                        Therefore for most of its existence it has been mainly used in offline rendering, meaning images and
                        visual effects for movies, where time is not of the essence.
                        <br>In the past few years we have seen a start of it being used in real time applications like video games
                        through the use of specific graphics cards that greatly improve the time and resources it requires.</p>
                    <h2>Why use raytracing?</h2>
                    <p>As mentioned in the previous section, raytracing produces photorealistic results. This is done by
                        simulating effects that we experience in our everyday life. <br>Such examples are the reflection and
                        refraction of light when it collides with an opaque or transparent enough object respectively, or the scattering and dispersion of it.
                        <br>These effects produce realistic soft shadows instead of "baked" hard shadows<a href="sources.html"><sup>(3)</sup></a> that look very defined
                        with sharp edges and reflections of objects on the ground or other surfaces.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>How does raytracing work?</h2>
                    <p id="how">In the most simple explanation a ray is "shot" from the camera, meaning from the user's point of view (POV),
                        if that ray hits a surface then depending on the properties of that surface it can do any of three things.
                        These three things are :</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Produce a mirrored reflection ray that will in turn hit a surface and create the reflection of the former object on the latter.</li>
                        <li>Produce a refraction ray if the surface is transparent enough for light to pass through it.
                            This ray can exit the object and hit other surfaces, resulting in more rays of the three types mentioned.</li>
                        <li>Produce a shadow ray that will travel towards the light(s), if that ray is intercepted by another object that is opaque
                            during its travel to a light then it means that the light does not illuminate the surface that created the shadow ray.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For more detailed and complicated examples of raytracing, see the <a href="examples.html">Examples</a> page.</p>

                    <h2>Disadvantages and solutions</h2>
                    <p id="dis">Above we mentioned that despite how realistic the results of raytracing are, it's also quite performance-heavy.
                        <br>This is due to the fact that this recursive creation of rays, each ray creates another and so forth,
                        takes quite some time to create the desired results and is also difficult for most hardware to do the
                        computations needed for so many rays while also rendering an entire scene real time. <br>Therefore, until
                        recently it was almost impossible for commercially available GPUs to use raytracing in real time for games since they lacked hardware-accelerated raytracing,
                        so they used software-accelerated raytracing for offline renders that can take hours to complete.
                        <br>In the last 2 years Nvidia and AMD have released cards that incorporate hardware acceleration and
                        have made real time raytracing a possibility for everyone that can afford it.
                        <br>However, it is still quite demanding in most cases.</p>
                    <h3>So what can we do to alleviate some of the weight of this technique?</h3>
                    <p>One of the simpler and most used solutions is to just limit the amount of rays that can be created.
                        <br>To set a specific depth after which no more rays are produced by another ray or an adaptive depth depending on
                        the desired quality. <br>Another solution is to decrease the intensity of a ray depending on how far it has travelled or with what it has collided.
