                        <li>I have a quite good knowledge of Java, having used it in many of my university's projects.</li>
                        <li>C++ is my favourite language due to the freedom it gives you and I like working with it despite it's increased difficulty.</li>
                        <li>I don't use Python that much but I consider myself to have decent knowledge of it and I like doing quick and rather small projects with it.</li>
