                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p>Some of my hobbies are video games, movies and foreign TV shows because
                    I enjoy them as means of escaping reality and being transferred in alternate "universes".
                    <br>I usually like to play team based FPS games and single-player RPGs.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p><br>As for movies and shows I love the Sci-Fi and Cyberpunk genre, with movies like
                    Blade Runner, Interstellar and Ghost In The Shell being some of my favourites.
                    <br>But I won't say no to more grounded on earth topics like societal problems presented on Parasite and Marriage Story.
                    <br>You can check the movies and shows I've watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/user/ur98188781/watchlist?ref_=nv_usr_wl_all_0">here</a>
                    and my ratings <a href="https://www.imdb.com/user/ur98188781/ratings?ref_=nv_usr_rt_4">here</a>.
                <br><br>I also enjoy working out in the gym or at home due to the current circumstances.
                <br>I also really like playing football and basketball and going on rides with my mountain bike.</p>

                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p>Some of my interests intersect with my hobbies. That's mostly because
                    I would like to work on video games, so I take an interest on video game developing and designing.
                <br>Additionally, I'm deeply interested in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
                    I'm amazed by what we can do with them and what they can do for us.
                <br>I also take an interest on cybersecurity and privacy, as they are quite important
                    in our ever progressing digital world.
                <br><br>Apart from these computer science centered interests, I love astrophysics and astronomy as I believe they hold the future of humanity.
                <br>I like learning about our universe and our attempts to explore it.</p>
