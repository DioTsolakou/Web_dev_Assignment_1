                <h2>What is raytracing?</h2>
                <p>According to Wikipedia, raytracing is a rendering technique in 3D graphics. A method of generating
                    an image by tracing the path of light and simulating the effects it has on the objects in the surrounding area.
                    The reason for its use is due to the highly realistic results that it produces, often blurring the line
                    between reality and virtual images if given the time and done correctly.
                    For these results, however, raytracing requires a considerable amount of resources and time.
                    Therefore for most of its existence it has been mainly used in offline rendering, meaning images and
                    visual effects for movies, where time is not of the essence.
                    In the past few years we have seen a start of it being used in real time applications like video games
                    through the use of specific graphics cards that greatly improve the time and resources it requires.</p>
                <h2>Why use raytracing?</h2>
                <p>As mentioned in the previous section, raytracing produces photorealistic results. This is done by
                    simulating effects that we experience in our everyday life. Such examples are the reflection and
                    refraction of light when it collides with an opaque or transparent enough object respectively, or the scattering and dispersion of it.</p>
